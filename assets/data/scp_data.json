    "Flood-Prone Areas": "Coastal states (Lagos, Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Akwa Ibom), low-lying areas in Kogi, Benue, and Niger. High-risk urban centers with inadequate drainage.",
    "Rainfall Predictions": "Above-normal rainfall expected in southern Nigeria (Lagos, Cross River, Akwa Ibom). Normal to below-normal rainfall in northern regions. Rainfall intensity expected to increase by 10-15% in coastal areas.",
    "Climate Trends": "Temperatures projected to be above the long-term average. Dry spells expected in northern states and Oyo. Increased desertification threats in semi-arid regions.",
    "Extreme Weather Events": "Flash floods in urban areas with poor drainage, windstorms during seasonal transitions, increased dust haze from Nov-Feb. Severe thunderstorms predicted for inland cities.",
    "Historical Flood Data": "Past severe floods recorded in Maiduguri, Borno (Sept 2024), and urban centers with inadequate drainage. 2012 and 2018 were peak flood years, with extensive damage across riverine communities.",
    "Risk Assessments": "High-risk areas: coastal cities, riverine communities, and floodplains. Increased risk of waterborne diseases in flooded regions. Rising flood vulnerability due to rapid urbanization and deforestation.",
    "Flood Management Recommendations": "Early warning systems using NiMet forecasts, improved drainage maintenance, community flood education, and flood-resistant infrastructure development. Investment in smart water management and flood-proof housing.",
    "Yearly Flood Trends": "2010-2024: Increasing flood frequency, with peak events recorded in 2012, 2018, and 2024. Rising flood intensity in urbanized areas.",
    "Geographic Flood Maps": "NiMet flood hazard maps indicate extreme risk in Niger Delta, middle belt, and major urban centers with low drainage capacity.",
    "Government Policies": "National Flood Risk Reduction Strategy (2023) emphasizes integrated water resources management. Flood response committees set up for rapid intervention.",
    "Infrastructure Investments": "New drainage projects in Lagos and Abuja. Embankment reinforcements in coastal regions. Green infrastructure projects to absorb excess rainfall.",
    "Disaster Response Plans": "Proposed emergency shelter expansion, early evacuation protocols, and flood insurance policies for vulnerable communities."
